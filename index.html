      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm Harshini TS, a dedicated and curious Computer Science Engineering student at Sri Krishna College of Technology, Coimbatore. My passion lies in backend development, and I find joy in solving real-world problems through structured logic, clean architecture, and purposeful code.
        <br><br>
        During my internship at Stepping Edge Technologies, a dynamic service-based startup, I had the opportunity to work on three major live projects. I developed a fully featured To-Do Management System with advanced thread operations and reminders, created a CRM platform for e-commerce businesses, and engineered a complete Subscription Management System with seamless PayPal integration. These experiences sharpened my skills in Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and RESTful APIs ‚Äî giving me real insight into how scalable systems are built and maintained.
        <br><br>
        I‚Äôm a self-motivated learner who thrives on challenges and loves to build backend systems that are efficient, secure, and easy to maintain. I believe in writing thoughtful code and collaborating effectively to deliver solutions that make a real difference.
        <br><br>
        As I continue my journey in the tech world, I aspire to grow into a full-stack developer and contribute to building high-impact products that solve real-world problems.
